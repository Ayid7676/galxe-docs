# Introduction

At Galxe, we are building the infrastructure to power an open and collaborative credential data network. We help Web3 developers leverage credential data to build better products and communities. At the same time, data curators contribute to our credential data network while earning income once the data is utilized. You can learn more about Galxe at our [website](http://galxe.com) and this [deep dive](https://blog.galxe.com/deep-dive-into-project-galaxy-abd33eceb19b) article.

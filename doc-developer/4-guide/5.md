# How to set a REST credential through dashboard

## Introductions[](https://docs.galxe.com/developer/guide/subgraph-cred#introductions)

REST type credential takes a single wallet address as input and outputs 0(false)/1(true) to indicate whether the wallet address is eligible. We support GET and POST method:

* **GET**:  Endpoint (HTTPs), Headers and Expression.
* **POST**: Endpoint (HTTPs), Headers, Post Body and Expression

## GET

### Endpoint[](https://docs.galxe.com/developer/guide/subgraph-cred#graphql-endpoint-https)

It's the standard HTTP request URL. `$address` is user address placeholder, you can put it on query params (`info?address=$address`) or as path variable (`/info/$address`)

NOTE: [galxe.com](http://galxe.com) is forbid use

### Headers

Optional; HTTP request header

NOTE: Cookie header is forbid set

### Expression

A JavaScript (ES6) function with this type signature: `(object) => int`. The function must be anonymous, which means that the first line of the expression should be like `function(data) {}`, instead of `let expression = (data) => {}`.

The function should return either number 1 or 0, representing if the address is eligible for this subgraph credential. Behind the scenes, first, we send the request with the user's address to the  endpoint, and then we will apply the function against the 'data' field of the response. If the returned value is 1, then user can own this credential, otherwise not.

### Example

Polygon OAT Holder

### Expression

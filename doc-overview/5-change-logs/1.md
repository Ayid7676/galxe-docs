### **New Networks: Optimism & loTeX**

The new networks we now support include: [Optimism ](https://www.optimism.io/)and[ IoTeX](https://iotex.io/start?gclid=Cj0KCQjw3eeXBhD7ARIsAHjssr-nYakDZe4BVCMkMj5XMj9GD_PGNu129kCIVR5pXWmvPGAOKicYAToaAgt2EALw_wcB).

\-Optimism is an Ethereum-based decentralized infrastructure platform that allows for instant transactions and scale-able smart contracts.

\-IoTex is a scale-able blockchain network that takes the internet of things (IoT) landscape to a new level.

### **Explore Page**

The Galxe campaign explore page has been updated to include an “Available to Claim” function. This ensures users don't ever miss an opportunity to participate in an upcoming/current campaign.

### **Snapshot.org Plugin**

With the [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org) plugin, users can easily create a campaign related to snapshot and integrate it into snapshot. This update will incentive communities to participate in the proposal vote by rewarding them with OATs (On-Chain Achievement Tokens). Note: The Space Admin can add this plugin into your space. After users vote, they can claim an OAT directly from the Galxe Plugin section on the proposal page Snapshot. Follow the instructions below to set up this plugin:

#### 1. Preparation

1. Create a Snapshot proposal on [](https://snapshot.org/)<https://snapshot.org/>
2. Create a Snapshot Credential with the proposal ID created from step1 on [](https://galxe.com/)<https://galxe.com/>
3. Create an OAT campaign ONLY with the credential created from step2 on [](https://galxe.com/)<https://galxe.com/>

#### 2. Add Galxe Plugin to your space

In Snapshot space setting, you can search and find the Galxe Plugin in the plugins section, and add it to your space.

#### 3. Set config JSON

Add campaign and proposal info to your plugin.

First, click the plugin, then you will see an editor section. See example below:

Second, fill it with the proposal ID and the information of the Campaign which you would like to link with the proposal. If you have multiple proposals which all distribute OATs to voters, you can also add multiple proposalID-campaignInfo pairs at one time.

**Note:** if you delete a proposalID-campaignInfo pair, people won’t see the OAT information on the page of your proposal even if the proposal ends or the OATs have already been distributed.

*DEMO:*

### **Google Sheets**

Galxe continues to support more and more credential types to allow communities to interact/grow in unique ways. Our platform now supports Google Sheets as one of our newest credentials sources. Communities can now track when Users interact with Google Forms/ Type Forms and can reward accordingly. This feature connects to the google API to read a specified column on the google sheet. The column can include a wallet, email, EVM, or Solana address. It can also include a Twitter ID or Discord ID.

### **Discord Role**

The Galxe Discord Bot has been upgraded and now supports setting a Discord role for a user based on the credentials a user holds. All current credentials are supported in this Discord role feature.

### **CSV File Upload**

Galxe has now optimized the speed of uploading csv files when creating credentials. Essentially, uploading credentials is much faster now!

### **Galxe Web Updates**

\-CI changes have been reverted and gql types have been updated. card UI bugs have been fixed as well. 

\-Users can now share campaign/campaign details along with space detail pages. This means that users can now share campaigns powered by Galxe to Twitter, or copy the campaign link to share elsewhere.

### **Discord Message Credential**

Members who send messages in Discord have the opportunity to be awarded an OAT (On-Chain Achievement Token) for their participation. Currently, this feature can only be utilized from the backend.

## **Week Of: 08/29-09/04**

### **Discord Verification Process**

This week, Galxe has changed the verification process of Discord accounts to OAuth. OAuth, or **open authorization,** is a widely adopted authorization framework that allows users to consent to an application interacting with another without having to reveal their passwords. The framework does this by providing access tokens to third-party services without exposing user credentials. This change means that partners now have a simpler way to verify discord accounts.

### **ENS & Space ID Integration**

Galxe integrated ENS and Space ID to our dashboard. Users can now set their ENS or Space ID domain as their Galxe ID name.

### **Github Verification Process**

Galxe has also changed the verification process of Github accounts to OAuth. OAuth, or **open authorization,** is a widely adopted authorization framework that allows users to consent to an application interacting with another without having to reveal their passwords. The framework does this by providing access tokens to third-party services without exposing user credentials. This change means that partners now have a simpler way to verify discord accounts.

### **Discord AMA Bot Optimization**

![](assets/image-2-1-.png)

Galxe’s Discord AMA bot optimization is officially online!

\-If a user quits aAMA, and joins again, they will still be eligible for the credential if they meet the minimum participation time.

\-If a user is in the voice channel and doesn’t quit even though the AMA has ended, they will still be eligible for the credential if they have met the minimum participation time.

\-Users can also use the command line to inquire about their eligibility after an AMA ends. The command line will return their participation and requirement time.

### **Explore Page**

The Project Galaxy campaign explore page has been updated to include an “Available to Claim” function. This ensures users don't ever miss an opportunity to participate in an upcoming/current campaign.

### **Snapshot.org Plugin**

With the [snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org) plugin, users can easily create a campaign related to snapshot and integrate it into snapshot. This update will incentive communities to participate in the proposal vote by rewarding them with OATs (On-Chain Achievement Tokens). Note: The Space Admin can add this plugin into your space. After users vote, they can claim an OAT directly from the Project Galaxy Plugin section on the proposal page Snapshot. Follow the instructions below to set up this plugin:

#### 1. Preparation

1. Create a Snapshot proposal on [](https://snapshot.org/)<https://snapshot.org/>
2. Create a Snapshot Credential with the proposal ID created from step1 on [](https://galaxy.eco/)<https://galaxy.eco/>
3. Create an OAT campaign ONLY with the credential created from step2 on [](https://galaxy.eco/)<https://galaxy.eco/>

#### 2. Add Project Galaxy Plugin to your space

In Snapshot space setting, you can search and find the Project Galaxy Plugin in the plugins section, and add it to your space.

#### 3. Set config JSON

Add campaign and proposal info to your plugin.

First, click the plugin, then you will see an editor section. See example below:

Second, fill it with the proposal ID and the information of the Campaign which you would like to link with the proposal. If you have multiple proposals which all distribute OATs to voters, you can also add multiple proposalID-campaignInfo pairs at one time.

**Note:** if you delete a proposalID-campaignInfo pair, people won’t see the OAT information on the page of your proposal even if the proposal ends or the OATs have already been distributed.

*DEMO:*

### **Google Sheets**

Project Galaxy continues to support more and more credential types to allow communities to interact/grow in unique ways. Our platform now supports Google Sheets as one of our newest credentials sources. Communities can now track when Users interact with Google Forms/ Type Forms and can reward accordingly. This feature connects to the google API to read a specified column on the google sheet. The column can include a wallet, email, EVM, or Solana address. It can also include a Twitter ID or Discord ID.

### **Discord Role**

The Project Galaxy Discord Bot has been upgraded and now supports setting a Discord role for a user based on the credentials a user holds. All current credentials are supported in this Discord role feature.

### **CSV File Upload**

Project Galaxy has now optimized the speed of uploading csv files when creating credentials. Essentially, uploading credentials is much faster now!

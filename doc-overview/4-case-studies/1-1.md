# Protocol Growth: Odos

![](assets/odos-case-study-banner.png)

### **Challenge:**

As the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem continues to evolve and mature, it's becoming increasingly challenging for new projects to gain traction and stand out in the crowded market. This is especially true for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that operate on different blockchain protocols.

[Odos](https://www.odos.xyz/) faced this exact challenge when it launched less than a year ago. Odos is a multi-chain DEX aggregator that currently supports [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/), [BNB Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/en), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), and [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/). Despite its innovative features, such as multi-token input swap functionality and Smart Order Routing (SQR) with great rates, the platform struggled with lack of exposure, social following, and on-chain growth. In order to boost on-chain and off-chain growth simultaneously, Odos needed to find an effective way to increase its social media presence, promote unique features, and drive the usage of its platform.

### **Solution:**

The team at Odos turned to [Galxe](https://galxe.com?utm_source=MediumBlog&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Odos+Case+Study), a leading Web3 credential data network, to help them achieve their growth objectives:

1. Attract New Users
2. Increase Trading on their DEX
3. Generate Brand Awareness

Galxe's [large credential database](https://gal.xyz/CredentialDataNetwork), and self-serve dashboard, along with its plug-and-play features such as [OATs (On-chain Achievement Tokens)](https://gal.xyz/GalxeOAT) and [Drop Campaigns](https://gal.xyz/GalxeDropCampaign), allowed Odos to leverage Galxe's community power and NFT rewards to begin their on-chain loyalty program.

Since Galxe’s dashboard is really intuitive to navigate, Odos got started instantly and launched [a variety of campaigns in their Space](https://galxe.com/odos?utm_source=MediumBlog&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=ODOS_Space) to increase new users, and drive retention and exposure. In September, Odos introduced themselves to the Galxe community by launching their first campaign where participants were awarded an [Early Supporter OAT](https://galxe.com/odos/campaign/GCjtWUt2xW?utm_source=MediumBlog&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Early_Supporter_OAT_Campaign). Odos was off to a great start by ending their very first campaign successfully with 38,406 mints.

Without any hassle, Odos was able to follow up with a series of interactive campaigns to convert their early supporters into loyal community members, encouraging them to trade across different Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains that included [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), and more. For instance, the [Find Your Path on Arbitrum campaign](https://galxe.com/odos/campaign/GChMBUtwGc?utm_source=MediumBlog&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Find+Your+Path+on+Arbitrum) [](https://galxe.com/odos/campaign/GCjtWUt2xW?utm_source=MediumBlog&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Early_Supporter_OAT_Campaign)in October demonstrated Odos’ capability to swap into 41 tokens on Arbitrum, and as a reward, the NFT issued on Galxe reached 516,071 mints! Odos also utilized Galxe’s campaign features in the following months to easily create similar campaigns and rewards to engage with their users even further.

For the holiday season, Odos launched a [Holiday Avalanche campaign](https://galxe.com/odos/campaign/GCSTuUwUZi?utm_source=MediumBlog&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Odos+Holiday+Avalanche) to incentivize users to take advantage of their multi-token input swap function, that is, users can swap as many as 6 tokens in a single transaction. How amazing is that! Additionally, an exquisitely designed NFT was given out to award users, drive on-chain actions, and increase usage on the Odos platform.

### Results:

In less than 90 days of leveraging Galxe's credential data network and growth-hacking tools, Odos saw remarkable results both on-chain and off-chain. On-chain growth was highlighted by an increase from $6M to $9.4B+ cumulative trading volume, 3.1M+ total swaps, and 91K+ users. Off-chain growth was highlighted by [a 900 to 163K+ increase in Twitter followers](https://twitter.com/odosprotocol). This impressive data showcased that having an always-on strategy and partnering up for campaigns lead to the most retention and success.

*“Galxe has been an instrumental partner in our GTM strategy. Its unique credential network combined with strong Web3 user engagement delivered outstanding results and made it easy for us to deploy and manage highly complex campaigns. We are excited to continue our collaboration with Galxe as we grow Odos and launch new products"*, said Yuri Papadin, COO at Semiotic Labs / Odos.

Overall, Odos was able to boost on-chain and off-chain growth simultaneously by using Galxe's tools and leveraging our community and marketing power. Odos’ case perfectly demonstrated how Web3 projects, especially those in the early stage, can drive on-chain and off-chain growth with Galxe hassle-free.

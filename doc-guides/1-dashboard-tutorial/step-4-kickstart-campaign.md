## Raffle Feature Campaign

Please refer to example: [Galxe x SID Games Festival Genius Raffle](https://galxe.com/Galxe/campaign/GCs6WUwxwG) 

> üí° The Raffle Feature is designed to allow projects to give away whitelist spots in a lucky draw format. Projects are free to design their campaign using the raffle feature into a raffle campaign. In future, the feature will allow other prizes (such as tokens, merchandise etc.) to be distributed.

### **To create this campaign...**

1. Navigate to your profile avatar (top right), and click on **My Spaces** to your space
2. Click **Create** > **Create Campaign**

![](assets/raffle-campaign-1.png)

3. Hover over the page's left sidebar, select Campaign Info, and fill up the required fields

* For raffle campaigns, it is compulsory to set both the start and end dates for the campaign period

![](assets/raffle-campaign-2.png)

4Ôªø. Next, onto the **Rewards** section, select **Custom Reward** and fill up the:

* Reward Name
* Participants‚Äô ID Type

  * either EVM Address, Solana Address, Email
  * After the campaign ends, the participants‚Äô addresses can be downloaded on the campaign page based on the ID type selected

![](assets/raffle-campaign-3.png)

5Ôªø. Lastly, onto the **How to Participate** section:

* **Reward Distribution Method** - select ‚ÄúRaffle‚Äù
* **Amount of Winners** - state the number of winners to be chosen for the whitelist spots
* **Participation Requirement** - select one or more credentials to determine the eligibility of the campaign

  * **Note:** a raffle campaign usually comes with additional prizes distributed by partners, which could be in the form of tokens, exclusive merchandise or collectibles. That said, in order to reduce the dilution of the exclusive rewards and prevent participation from bots, partners could set sybil prevention (KYC) tasks/credentials. Some of the sybil credentials include the Galxe Passport* Holders, Ethereum Transactors and BAB Holders etc.

  \**Galxe Passport is a soul-bound NFT that proves that you have completed a KYC*

  * **Sybil Credentials Found on our Platform**

    * [Galxe Passport Holder](https://galxe.com/credential/191773898980368384)
    * [Ethereum Transactors (1 Transaction)](https://galxe.com/credential/168916022259785728)
    * [Ethereum Transactors (10 Transactions)](https://galxe.com/credential/187770474584514560)

### EVM Address Credential

> The EVM Credential is designed to provide proof that a user has completed a task on a perspective EVM Chain. EVM Chain examples: Ethereum, BNB CHAIN, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Moonbeam etc.

üí°The user can see and select all credentials from any user while creating the space campaign, but on the ‚ÄúCurated Credentials‚Äù page, the user can only see and edit their own created credential list.

### Credential Source

Under Credential Source, select the relevant type for your project.

#### 1. Snapshot

The user can update the holder list via **CSV file** (or via API. [Learn how to update via the API](https://docs.galxe.com/developer/guide/api-cred-items-update/) - [](https://docs.galxe.com/developer/guide/api-cred-items-update/)<https://docs.galxe.com/developer/guide/api-cred-items-update/>)

#### 2. Subgraph

> Applies to on-chain credentials. The holder list will be updated from [thegraph.com](https://thegraph.com/en/) through the endpoint/query/expression information specified.

IÔªøt requires 3 fields to be filled:¬†**Queries (HTTP)**,¬†**Query** and¬†**Expression**

##### Queries (HTTP) Endpoint

##### **Query**

Use this query to check whether an address is eligible for the credential or not

This section should include the JavaScript Code used to convert the above Query result into a 0/1 output with 0 as the non-eligible queried address and 1 as the eligible credential

#### Twitter Follow Action

The Twitter Follow action requires users to follow a Twitter account. 

*E.g.*[https://twitter.com/Galxe](https://twitter.com/GalxeHQ*)

üí° It would be best to create the Twitter Follow Credential about 1 to 3 days before the campaign release. After the setup, the sync rate will be 10k data per hour.

üí°Please input the full link of the Twitter account. We don‚Äôt support detecting Twitter handle at the moment



#### Twitter Retweet and Like Actions

The Twitter Retweet and Like action requires users to retweet and like a tweet respectively.

* Projects need to create the Twitter posts first, and include the URL to the credential

*E.g.*<https://galxe.com/smoothie/campaign/GCsozUt9UW>

#### Twitter Space Action

The Twitter space action requires users to participate in a Twitter Space.

*E.g.*<https://galxe.com/credential/185358493101498368>

[](https://galaxy.eco/salad-ventures/campaign/GCVHSUtXji)üí° However, there are some *limitations* for the **Twitter space** credential. And projects are required to inform participants in advance.

* Only participants that¬†**log in**¬†Twitter accounts can be captured
* Only participants that attend the Twitter space using¬†**mobile**¬†will be captured.
* Host and speakers¬†can not¬†be captured.
* Due to Twitter restrictions, we can only issue this credential to¬†at most **1000**¬†participants. The longer they listen, the more likely they can get the credential. 



#### Twitter Quote Tweet Action

The Twitter Quote Tweet action requires users to quote a tweet. 

*E.g.* [](https://twitter.com/GalxeHQ/status/1575184078843699200?cxt=HHwWgICjtd7kltwrAAAA)*<https://twitter.com/GalxeHQ/status/1575184078843699200?cxt=HHwWgICjtd7kltwrAAAA>*

### Discord Credentials

> The Discord option is chosen for Discord-related formats. There are **two types**: 1) Discord Voice Channel and 2) Discord Member

#### 1. Discord Voice Channel (a.k.a AMA)

##### **About Discord Voice Channel**

* This Discord Voice Channel tracks Discord IDs instead of wallet addresses. It would be tracked automatically. And the credential will be updated immediately after participants leave the AMA channel.

  * Users have to link their Discord to their Galxe ID to claim it. Once linked, users will need to proceed to the campaign page, in order for the credential to detect that their discord account has been included under the special role.

üí° **Galxe Discord Bot** allows the following to be tracked and exported into credentials: ‚Ä¢ Discord Followers ‚Ä¢ Discord Specific Roles / Channel ‚Ä¢ Discord AMA (Eg. participants tuning to the AMA for 15 mins consecutively will be able\
to claim an OAT or NFT) ‚Ä¢ Discord Messaging (members who messaged xx no. of times)

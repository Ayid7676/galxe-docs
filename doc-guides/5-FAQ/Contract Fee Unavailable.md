#What should I do when encountering a “Contract Fee is Temporarily Unavailable” error?

## Option 1: Switch your wallet to a different blockchain and then switch back to the original.

---
The rpc endpoint of a blockchain is controlled by your wallet not Project Galaxy. Try to switch your wallet to a different blockchain and then switch back to the original one to see if the error is fixed.

## Option 2: Change your blockchain rpc endpoint to a custom one.
Go to Settings > Network > The network you are using > New RPC URL. Paste the custom rpc endpoint into the text box. You can find the public available rpc endpoints on [ankr public rpc](https://www.ankr.com/protocol).

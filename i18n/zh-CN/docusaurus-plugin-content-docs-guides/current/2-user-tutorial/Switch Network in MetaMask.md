# Switch Network in Your Wallet

Galxe currently supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Fantom, Avalanche, and Solana. Sometimes you need to switch the network in your wallet to participate in various campaigns, and here’s the guide on how to accomplish that

## Find the RPC addresses of the networks

You can easily find all the networks on [https://chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/). You will be redirected to the networks’ websites and docs by clicking on them.

If you have a Metamask already, choose “Add To Metamask” to add the networks, and then click on the **Approve** button to allow the prompt.

## Switch networks on Metamask

Once you've added your desired network, you can switch networks by opening MetaMask and clicking at the top of the MetaMask extension. You'll see **your current network** displayed, click on it and you can select any network from the drop-down list.

Once you click in, you should now be on your desired network.

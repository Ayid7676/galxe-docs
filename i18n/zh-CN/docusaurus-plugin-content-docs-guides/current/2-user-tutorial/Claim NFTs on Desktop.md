2. Choose the campaign
3. Connect your wallet and choose the blockchain
4. Claim! (or pay to claim if the campaign requires a payment)
5. **Remember, when you confirm the transaction, DO NOT adjust the gas limit in your wallet or make sure the gas limit is above 180000. Otherwise the transaction will be failed.**

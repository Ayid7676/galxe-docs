# Build with Credentials

Project Galaxy provides **Applications Modules**, **Credential Oracle Engine**, and **Credential API** for developers to leverage credential data to build better products and communities.

Use cases of our **Application Modules** include

- Galaxy OATs (On-chain Achievement Tokens),
- NFT Loyalty Programs,
- Growth Hacking Campaigns,
- Gated Community,
- Customized Governance,
- and more

Developers can also utilize the **Credential Oracle Engine** and **Credential API** for more customized use cases such as credit scoring and sybil attack prevention algorithms.

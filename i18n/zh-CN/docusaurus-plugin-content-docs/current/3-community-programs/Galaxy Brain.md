# Galaxy Brain

Galaxy Brains are engaged and active community members who are selected by the Project Galaxy team with the mission to guide and lead their fellow community members.

Members who hold the Galaxy Brain title are not contracted by the team nor are they official Project Galaxy representatives.

The Galaxy Brain role is not something a user can apply for or ask for, it is a role that is given to selected users for their amazing effort and volunteer work within the community.

Galaxy Brains work closely with the core team in various efforts to make sure that information and support can be spread through the right channels to all of Project Galaxy's users.

The Galaxy Brain role is an earned role, but it can also be revoked by the Project Galaxy team. Inactivity without reason, and innapropriate behavior to users are a few reasons why it could be revoked.

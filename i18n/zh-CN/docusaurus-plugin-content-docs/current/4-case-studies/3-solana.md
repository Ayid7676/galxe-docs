# Ecosystem Growth with Solana

### **SOL COOL 2022**

## Challenge

Project Galaxy was adding the Solana blockchain to its existing list of 6 different blockchain ecosystems. It was the first time Project Galaxy was integrating a non-EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chain into its protocol. We wanted to help bring our existing community from the other 6 EVM chains to Solana, by offering some incentives to get started.

## Solution

Initiated by Project Galaxy and powered by Solana, the “2022 is gonna be SOL Cool” event was an inclusive multi-chain campaign that brought together protocols in one massive campaign.  Project Galaxy infrastructure helped 27 different protocols reach their marketing growth goals through the joint “2022 is gonna be SOL Cool” campaign.

With a Prize Pool of over  $1,000,000 Prize Pool, users embarked on a digital treasure hunt to claim 27 NFTs within one campaign. The campaign included 27 leading protocols such as **Raydium, Wormhole, Apricot Finance, Orca, Slope Finance, Serum, Bonfida, Port Finance, Drift Protocol, SpaceRunners, Ancient8, Genopets, Sypool, Mango, Cyberconnect, 01, Clover Finance, STEPN, Zebec Protocol, Francium, 1sol, Realy, Solend, Dappio, Jupiter, Marinade, and ScareCity.**

## Results

The campaign attracted attention and eyes to the Solana ecosystem as a whole. Overall, Project Galaxy helped grow the Solana ecosystem with over 33,400 new users joining the campaign with each unique user trying an average of 5 protocols on Solana. We are also proud to say that 4,826 users completed 10 or more tasks from different partners.
